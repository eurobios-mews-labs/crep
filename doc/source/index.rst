Tabular data processing for Continuous REPresentation
=====================================================

   :alt: code coverage

To install, run:

.. code-block:: python

    pip install crep

This simple module provides functions for handling tabular data with a continuous axis. In certain cases, this index can represent time, but this tool was initially developed to address railway descriptions.

The tool is designed to represent linear structures (cables, rails, beams, pipes) with piece-wise constant characteristics, even when the segment lengths are highly variable.

Basic usage
-----------

**Merge function**: Merges two DataFrames.

.. code-block:: python

    import pandas as pd
    from crep import merge

    df_left = pd.DataFrame(
        dict(id=[2, 2, 2],
             t1=[0, 100, 120],
             t2=[100, 120, 130],
             data1=[0.2, 0.1, 0.5])
    )
    df_right = pd.DataFrame(
        dict(id=[2, 2, 2],
             t1=[0, 80, 100],
             t2=[70, 100, 140],
             data2=[0.1, 0.3, 0.2])
    )

    ret = merge(data_left=df_left,
                data_right=df_right,
                id_continuous=["t1", "t2"],
                id_discrete=["id"],
                how="outer")

The resulting output is:

Tools
-----

To check if your data is admissible for the merge function, you can use the `tools` module.

.. code-block:: python

    import pandas as pd
    from crep import tools

    df_admissible = pd.DataFrame(
        dict(id=[2, 2, 2],
             t1=[0, 100, 120],
             t2=[100, 120, 130],
             data1=[0.2, 0.1, 0.5])
    )
    df_not_admissible = pd.DataFrame(
        dict(id=[2, 2, 2],
             t1=[0, 90, 120],
             t2=[100, 120, 130],
             data1=[0.2, 0.1, 0.5])
    )
    # The second table is not admissible because two values are possible for t in [90,100].

    assert tools.admissible_dataframe(
        df_admissible, id_continuous=["t1", "t2"],
        id_discrete=["id"])
    assert not tools.admissible_dataframe(
        df_not_admissible, id_continuous=["t1", "t2"],
        id_discrete=["id"])
    print(tools.sample_non_admissible_data(
        df_not_admissible, id_continuous=["t1", "t2"],
        id_discrete=["id"]
    ))
    # id  t1   t2  data1
    # 1   2  90  120    0.1
